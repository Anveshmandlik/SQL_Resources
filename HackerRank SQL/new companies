SELECT c.company_code, c.founder,
COUNT(DISTINCT e.lead_manager_code),COUNT(DISTINCT e.senior_manager_code),
COUNT(DISTINCT e.manager_code), COUNT(DISTINCT e.employee_code)
FROM Company c INNER JOIN Employee e 
ON c.company_code = e.company_code
GROUP BY company_code, founder
ORDER BY company_code ASC
